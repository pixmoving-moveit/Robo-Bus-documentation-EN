- **No spectators are allowed** around the vehicle during operation.
  
- **Avoid using the chassis** in rainy weather (as the safety personnel's visibility may be obstructed).
  
- **Do not use the chassis** in environments below -10°C.
  
- **Children are prohibited from loitering or playing** around the vehicle.
  
- **While riding in the vehicle**, do not overload it, and all passengers must wear seatbelts.
  
- **In non-emergency situations**, do not keep the emergency stop switch button pressed for extended periods.

## Battery Usage Precautions

> ### Warning ！

Notice and warning items using the battery,In order to prevent the battery leaking, getting hot and exploding, pleas e pay attention to preventing measure as following: 

- Never throw the battery into water, keep it under dry, shady and cool circumstance when not use.

- Never keep the battery beside high temperature source examples: fire, heating machine,ect. 

- Please use the stated charger when charging. 

- Never upside down the positive and negative. 

- Never cut the battery in socket directly 

- Never throw the battery into fire or heating machine. 

- Never connect the positive and negative of battery with metal. 

- Never ship or store the battery together with metal 

- Never knock, throw or trample the battery.

- Never cut through the battery with nail or other edge tool. 

- Never use the battery under strong static and strong magnetic field, otherwise it will destroy the protecting device 

- If battery leaked, the electrolyte get into eyes, please don’t knead, please wash eyes by water and send to hospital. Otherwise it will hurt eyes 

- If battery emit peculiar smell, heating, distortion or appear any unconventionality during using, storage or charging process, please take it out from device or charge and stop using.

- If the pole was duty, please clear it before using. 

- Please encase the pole with insulating paper when you want to abandon the battery to prevent exploding and getting into fire.

- Do not place the charger in the rain position! 

- There has high voltage components, do not dismantle the charger without authorization! 

- Do not block the charger air inlet and air outlet! 

- The battery voltage must match the nominal voltage of the charger! 

- Disconnect the power cord and the charging plug while moving the charger. 

- If you have any questions, you can call the company, and our company will serve you wholeheartedly。

## Parking Maintenance

> When the chassis is not used for an extended period, please follow the suggestions below:

- **Ensure the Vehicle is Stopped and Apply the Handbrake**  

The vehicle should be parked on a flat surface (it is prohibited to park the vehicle on a slope for a long time. If the vehicle must be parked on a slope due to a malfunction or other reasons, it must be blocked with a triangular wedge or a hard object such as a stone to prevent rolling). After the vehicle is stopped, the parking brake lever should be pulled up.

- **Protect from Rain, Moisture, and Dust**

The chassis's electrical components should not come into contact with rainwater or dust. When parking the vehicle, ensure it is protected from rain, and take measures to prevent dust and ensure insulation at the connections.

- **Disconnect the 12V Battery**

When the vehicle is parked for a long time, please disconnect the 12V small battery—remove the negative cable from the battery and insulate it.

- **Rust Prevention**  

Use a damp towel or brush to clean the vehicle, and apply rust prevention oil to necessary areas for routine maintenance.

- **Keep Away from Fire Sources and Low Temperatures**

When the temperature is below 0°C, the vehicle should be parked indoors to prevent low temperatures from causing the chassis to fail to start.
 
#### Before Starting the Chassis After Long-term Inactivity, Please Perform the Following Checks:

1. Check if the battery level meets operational requirements.

2. Inspect all oil pipe joints for any leaks.

3. Ensure the battery terminal connections are tight and that other wires are not loose.

4. Check tire pressure (230 KPa), steering, and braking functions to ensure they are normal.

5. Verify that lights and other signaling devices are functioning properly.

6. If any issues with the suspension, braking, steering, or connections are found, lubricate with an appropriate amount of lubricant.

7. Monitor the battery level, and charge the vehicle's battery promptly if it is too low.

8. Maintain a dry and ventilated charging environment, ensuring no flammable materials are within 2 meters of the vehicle and charging equipment.

9. Any issues identified during checks should be resolved before operating the vehicle.

## Regular Maintenance Recommendations

Regular maintenance of the chassis helps reduce component failures and extend its service life.

- **Structural Appearance**

  Power off and clean dust and stains from the chassis to prevent internal corrosion of components. Inspect the chassis structure, ensuring the paint surface is intact without peeling, bolts are tightly secured without loosening, and wire harnesses are intact without breaks. Apply grease to moving parts such as steering ball joints, suspension arm bushings, and arm mounting brackets. Check the harness leading to the upper installation to ensure there are no damages or breaks.

- **Steering System**  

  Inspect steering tie rod nuts for tightness without loosening, and ensure the steering knuckle arm is securely fastened. Test the steering to ensure it can turn to the maximum angle and automatically returns smoothly to the center position after releasing the joystick. Ensure there are no unusual noises during the steering process, and that the response is quick and smooth.

- **Braking System**

  Check that the brake calipers are not leaking oil and that the oil pipes are not damaged or broken. Confirm that the brake fluid reservoir is sufficiently filled, and it is recommended to replace the brake fluid every one to two years. Ensure that the brake discs are not deformed or cracked, and that the brake pads have not worn down to the safety line. Test the braking function to ensure it operates normally without unusual noises, and that there is no friction or resistance when releasing the brakes.

- **Drive System**

  Inspect the appearance of the wheel hubs and tires for any damage or deformation, and ensure that the hub motor installation nuts are tight. Check that tire pressure is adequate and that the tire tread has not worn down to the safety line. Test that the motor operates smoothly without unusual noises and that each wheel turns normally.

- **Handbrake System** 

  Check that the handbrake caliper is securely installed without loosening, and that the steel cable is tightened and not loose. Test that the handbrake releases normally and that the caliper engages and returns properly. Apply grease to the moving spring parts of the caliper.

- **Remote Control**
  
  Power off and clean dust and stains from the remote control. Check the battery level, and replace the battery promptly if it is low. Inspect the joystick, buttons, and levers on the remote control to ensure they operate properly.
