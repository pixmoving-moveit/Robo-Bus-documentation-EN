## Door System

1. Passenger Use  
   The door is equipped with a pinch-proof feature. The door can be opened and closed using buttons, with one button located in the center of the inside of the door and another in the center on the outside. The operation method involves briefly pressing the button for 1 second to perform the corresponding opening or closing action (after disconnecting the mechanical main power switch, the door controller must be activated by briefly pressing the door button for 1 second).

2. Emergency Opening Method for Passenger Door  
   - The external emergency switch and the internal emergency pull handle should only be used when the passenger door cannot be opened or closed using the button.
   - The emergency switch and handle are pull-cable types; significant force is required to forcibly open them when rotating the switch and pulling the handle.
   - Regularly check the lubrication of the door pump and ensure that bolts and nuts are not loose.

## Vehicle Charging Instructions

1. Charging the Vehicle

- Hold the IC card against the scanning area of the charging pile. After the card scans and you hear a "beep," remove the card. The charging pile will then start charging, and the charging indicator light will remain yellow.

2. Ending Vehicle Charging  
- To manually stop charging during the charging process, scan the card again to end the current charging session; the charging indicator light will go out. If an emergency occurs during charging, you can press the "Emergency Stop Button" located on the right side of the charging pile.
- Once the vehicle is fully charged and the charging pile system automatically cuts off the power, firmly grip the charging gun handle with your right hand, press the unlock button with your thumb, and pull the charging gun straight out with even force.
- Close the protective cover of the charging socket and the charging compartment door, and return the charging cable and gun to their designated storage location.

**Safety Precautions**

- The installation of the charger must strictly follow the PIX Moving "7KW Charging Pile Installation Specifications."
- It is strictly prohibited to store flammable and explosive materials near the charging location, and emergency access routes must not be blocked.
- Before starting the charger, ensure that the connection is fault-free, secure, and reliable, with no short circuits or other faults. The cables should be well-insulated and undamaged. Sharp objects must not be used to operate the charger.
- During charging, any operations unrelated to charging are strictly prohibited. Vehicle repairs, vehicle movement, disconnection of high-voltage maintenance switches, and relocation of the charger are all forbidden.
- After charging is complete, the power must be turned off before unplugging the charging gun. The charging gun should be placed in the designated location, ensuring it is protected from water and dust; the vehicle charging socket cover must be closed. Plugging and unplugging the charging gun while powered is strictly prohibited.
- A dry powder fire extinguisher should be available around the charging facility, and relevant personnel should be trained on how to use it to ensure they can handle emergencies correctly.
- Charging operations outdoors are strictly prohibited during rain or snow.
- In hot, dry summer weather, the risk of fire increases. Ensure proper ventilation in the charging environment and avoid direct sunlight as much as possible.
- Charging is prohibited when the ambient temperature exceeds 45°C.
- Some modules within the charging equipment may produce electrical sparks. To avoid accidents, do not perform charging operations at gas stations or in areas with flammable gases or liquids.
